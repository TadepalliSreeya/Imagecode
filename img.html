    <p>Friends are people with whom you share a close, personal bond characterized by mutual care, support, and shared experiences. They are individuals you enjoy spending time with and who offer companionship, especially during challenging times. Friendships are built on trust, honesty, and respect, and they enrich your life by providing a sense of belonging and purpose. </p>
